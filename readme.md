# Veteran Traveller

A program which generates Traveller RPG characters iteratively, preserving the eldest surviving character.

It should display the eldest character while generating subsequent successors in the background (with some indication of progress).

In case mine isn't working, yet, here's [pgorman's working generator](https://github.com/pgorman/travellercharactergenerator).

## Goals

A `blessed-contrib` TUI with:
- Current Best Character Profile

  - Title of Nobility
  - Military Rank
  - Age

  - Birthworld
